## Notes

- Work in progress
- At it's core, a set of tools to fill and show a postgres database
- Multiple relays can serve a payload for the same slot (if the winning builder sent the best bid to multiple relays, and the proposer asks for a payload from all of them)

## Overview

* Uses PostgreSQL as data store
* Configuration:
  * Relays in [`/vars/relays.go`](/vars/relays.go)
  * Builder aliases in [`/vars/builder_aliases.go`](/vars/builder_aliases.go)
  * Version and common env vars in [`/vars/vars.go`](/vars/vars.go)
* Some environment variables are required, see [`.env.example`](/.env.example)
* Saving and checking payloads is split into phases/commands:
  * [`data-api-backfill`](/cmd/core/data-api-backfill.go) -- queries the data API of all relays and puts that data into the database
  * [`check-payload-value`](/cmd/core/check-payload-value.go) -- checks all new database entries for payment validity
  * [`update-builder-stats`](/cmd/core/update-builder-stats.go) -- create daily builder stats and save to database


## Getting started

### Run

You can either build relayscan from the repository, or use the Docker image:

```bash
# Build & run
make build
./relayscan help
./relayscan version

# Run with Docker
docker run flashbots/relayscan
docker run flashbots/relayscan /app/relayscan version

---

# Grab delivered payloads from relays data API, and fill up database
./relayscan core data-api-backfill                     #  for all slots since the merge
./relayscan core data-api-backfill --min-slot 6658658  #  since a given slot (good for dev/testing)

# Double-check new entries for valid payments (and other)
./relayscan core check-payload-value

# Update daily builder inclusion stats
./relayscan core update-builder-stats --start 2023-06-04 --end 2023-06-06  # update daily stats for 2023-06-04 and 2023-06-05
./relayscan core update-builder-stats --start 2023-06-04                   # update daily stats for 2023-06-04 until today
./relayscan core update-builder-stats --backfill                           # update daily stats since last entry, until today

# Start the website (--dev reloads the template on every page load, for easier iteration)
./relayscan service website --dev

```

You might want to run Postgres locally for testing:

```
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres postgres
```

### Test & dev

```bash
# Install dependencies
go install mvdan.cc/gofumpt@latest
go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@v0.4.3
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@v1.51.2

# Lint, test and build
make lint
make test
make test-race
make build
```


### Updating relayscan

Notes for updating relayscan:

- Relay payloads are selected by `inserted_at`. When adding a new relay, you probably want to manually subtract a day from `inserted_at` so they don't show up all for today (`UPDATE mainnet_data_api_payload_delivered SET inserted_at = inserted_at - INTERVAL '1 DAY' WHERE relay='newrelay.xyz';`). See also https://github.com/flashbots/relayscan/issues/28
